👋 Hi I'm Niel, an undergrad studying EE at Stanford. 

I'm interested in neurons 🧠, learning systems, compute, and ML. I'm currently a member of the technical staff for a startup coming out of Google DeepMind building ML infrastructure for ultra-fast inference. At Stanford, I figure out how biological neurons activate⚡️ at the Brains in Silicon Lab with Professor Boahen and Kyrus Mama. 

Check out some of my work on test time compute for diffusion models and simulation of natural selection on my page.
