ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Niel, an undergrad studying EE at Stanford. 

I'm interested in neurons ðŸ§ , learning systems, compute, and ML. I'm currently a member of the technical staff for a startup coming out of Google DeepMind building fully vertical ML infrastructure for ultra-fast inference. At Stanford, I look to neurons and neural circuits as inspiration for more efficient learning systems at the Brains in Silicon Lab with Professor Boahen and Kyrus Mama. 

Check out some of my work on test-time compute scaling for diffusion models and simulation of natural selection on my page.
