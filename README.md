Hi I'm Niel, an undergrad studying EE at Stanford. 

I'm interested in advancing our understanding of neurons, learning systems, and ML. I'm currently a member of the technical staff of a startup coming out of Google DeepMind building high performance ML infrastructure. At Stanford, I figure out how biological neurons activate at the Brains in Silicon Lab with Professor Boahen and Kyrus Mama. 

I conduct independent research generally in the areas of the impact of data distributions on the performance of ML models, quantum teleportation and simulating quantum computing, simulation and probabilistic analysis of natural selection, and learning systems that self-generate learning rules. I'm working on making some of my independent research open source.

In the past, I've worked for startups on infrastructure for personalized healthcare, multimodal AI for product sales material generation, and automation of market research through the use of agentic digital twins.
